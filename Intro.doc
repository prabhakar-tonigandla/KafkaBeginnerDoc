Morning/Evening Everyone, We  are going to spend next 1 hour on Kafka and if there are any questions, I will answer them If I know or I can do some research and will get back to you If I don’t know.

First off all, We will understand WHY KAFKA?

• Real-time data streaming 
• Event-driven architectures
• Decoupling micro services

Horizantal Scalability
	• Can Scale to 100s of Brokers
	• Can scale to millions of Messages per second
High performance(Latency of less than 10 ms) - real time


Where to USE:
	• Messaging System
	• Activity Tracking
	• Gather Metrics from Many different locations
	• Application Logs Gathering
	• Stream processing
	• De-coupling of system dependencies 

• We can use Kafka to apply recommendations in real-time while you’re watching TV shows
• We can use Kafka to gather user, taxi and trip data in real-time to compute and forecast demand, and compute surge pricing in real-time
• Also to collect user interactions to make better connection recommendations in real-time.
